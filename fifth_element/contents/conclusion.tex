\section{Conclusion}

While the successive over-relaxation might be more challenging to implement, especially the choice of \(\omega\) is not easy, but if done well, the rate of convergence is potentially faster than the LU-decomposition. Specific to the poission problem, the choice of \(\omega\) does not seem to be dependent on the dimension and only \(N\), the number of grid points, affects \(\omega\).

Another result is that if we set \(\epsilon\), one of the termination condition of the iterative algorithm, to be \(\frac{1}{(N + 1)^k}\), then the speed of convergence does not get better than \(\frac{1}{n^2}\) which means that we probably should not set \(k\) higher than \(2\).
