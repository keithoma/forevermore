\section{Introduction}

This protocol discusses the effect of the rounding error caused by the limitations of machine numbers by observing the normed difference between the analytic and the numerical approximation of the first two derivatives of a periodic function. The results are then explained, and we furthermore consider the change in the error plot when the periodicity of the given function is altered.
