\section{Python Module User Manual}

In order to test and verify our thesis we have been creating
a little Python script experiments.py along with its
companion Python module derivative\_approximation.py.

You can recreate all those figures in our protocol, just run experiments.py.

If one desires, they may simply change the variables used in the file experiments.py.
They are located from line 13 to 20 and one may infer from the names and the comments the
use of said variables.
