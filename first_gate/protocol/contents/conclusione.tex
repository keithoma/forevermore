\section{Conclusion and Potential Experiments}

In the realm of computing, no matter the choice of the increment the approximation will always be just that, \textit{an approximation}. Uniform convergence happens only up to a point, and beyond that point decreasing the increment is fruitless, counterproductive even. Furthermore, we have seen that this sweet spot as we called it, depends on how strongly the input affects the output of the function, i.e. if the change in output is small, then a larger increment produces a relativly good result.

As we hypothesized earlier in section \ref{xxx}
