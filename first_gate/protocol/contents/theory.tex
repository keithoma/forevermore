In essence, the approximation of the derivative converges uniformly to the analytic one as the increment \(h\) becomes small enough. This realization, however, raises the question whether the aforementioned theory still holds true in the digital world of computing where the number line is far from complete. In the world where zero and one reign supreme, does the approximation still converge to the exact derivative?\\
