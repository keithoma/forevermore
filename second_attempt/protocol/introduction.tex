\section{Introduction: Setting the Stage}

This protocol discusses a numerical approach to solve a partial derivative equation (PDE). To stimulate the mind, consider a string fixed at both ends in a one dimensional space. A force affecting this string at a point \(x\) is the second derivative of the location scaled with the mass (which we will neglect for this particular example).
